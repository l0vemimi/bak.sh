Simple backup shell script.

**How to use:**

1. Make the script executable.

        chmod +x bak.sh

2. Run the script.

        ./bak.sh

Optionally you can create an alias for the scrip in .bashrc for easier use.

*NOTE: This assumes you're already familiar with sh, see GNUs [3.8 Shell Scripts](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Scripts.html).*

This is a very simple and basic script, I made it only because I am lazy.. It will save files into [*.tar.gz](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_chapter/index.html). This should go without saying but please do not use random scripts if you don't know what they do.
